SIS-simulations
===============


Fast C++ code for numerical simulation of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on networks. Possible simulation algorithms are the Gillespie Algorithm (event-based algorithm), Asynchronous updating and Synchronous updating (discrete-time algorithms). The time-step for the discrete-time algorithms is automatically set in the source code (src/S.h and src/AS.h) and can be modified if required.

Full details on compiling and running the simulations, interpreting the outputs and modifying the source code are given in the README.txt file.
