SIS-simulations
===============

Numerical Simulation programs for continuous-time SIS dynamics on networks. Please cite [1]: "An analysis of Synchronous and Asynchronous updating schemes for Markov processes on networks" by P.G. Fennell, S. Melnik and J.P. Gleeson (2014) if used.

Executable files are available for Windows, Mac and Linux and are contained in the repectively named folders. The C++ source code is contained in the folder src. man.txt contains details on how to perform the simulations from the terminal and how to interpret the outputs.
