# SIS-simulations

Numerical Simulation of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on complex networks. Possible simulation algorithms are the Gillespie Algorithm (event-based algorithm), Asynchronous updating and Synchronous updating (discrete-time algorithms). 

Download folder, then run the command
\>> make sim
from the terminal/command line (in the folder directory) to create the excecutable file sim. Once created, simulations are run by the excecutable file along with the relevant inputs 
\>> ./sim ...

Please see README.pdf for full information on compiling, running simulations and interpreting results.
