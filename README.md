SIS-simulations
===============

Numerical Simulation program for continuous-time SIS dynamics on networks. Please cite "An analysis of Synchronous and Asynchronous updating schemes for Markov processes on networks" by P.G. Fennell, S. Melnik and J.P. Gleeson (2014) if used.

Executable files are available for Windows, Mac and Linux and are contained in the repectively named folders. The C++ source code is contained in the folder src. For details on how to run the program from the terminal, how to interpret the outputs and how to modify the source code see man.txt.
