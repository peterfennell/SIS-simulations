# SIS-simulations

Numerical Simulation of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on complex networks. Possible simulation algorithms are the Gillespie Algorithm (event-based algorithm), Asynchronous updating and Synchronous updating (discrete-time algorithms). 

Please see README.pdf for information on compiling, running simulations and interpreting results.
