*********************************

---------------------------------
- 1.	Erdos-Renyi (ER) Graph	-
---------------------------------

To perform simulations on an ER Graph run the following command from the terminal in the same location as the executable file ASsim is located:

./ASsim sim beta mu X0 1 N z tend N_trials Xdat EXdat PXTdat

Explanation of variables
 - sim:         The simulation method to use. Takes values 1 for GA, 2 for AS and 3 for S.
 - beta:      	The SIS transmission rate. It can take any non-negative value
 - mu:	    	The SIS recovery rate. It can take any non-negative value
 - X0:	    	The number of nodes in the network that are initially infected
 - 1:	    	Indicates to perform simulations on an ER network
 - N:	    	The number of nodes in the networks
 - z:	    	The mean degree of the ER network
 - tend:    	The end time i.e. the length of time that the SIS dynamics should be simulated for
 - N_trials:	The number of stochastic trials to perform
 - Xdat:	    Takes values either 1 or 0; 1 indicates to the program to save data from each of the N_trials trials, 0 indicates not to save*.
 - EXdat:	    Takes values either 1 or 0; 1 indicates to the program to save the data average values over each of the N_trials trials, 0 indicates not to save*.
 - PXTdat:	    Takes values either 1 or 0; 1 indicates to the program to save the probability distributions formed from  data from each of the N_trials trials, 0 indicates not to save*

*For further inputs on the program outputs, see section "Outputs" below

EXAMPLE

The following three commands produces the data of the type used in
Figure 5 of [1] for the Gillespie Algorithm, Asynchronous updating
and Synchronous updating. That case was SIS dynamics on an ER
network of 1000 nodes and mean degree z=4 with beta = 0.2 and mu =
0.72.

./sim 1 0.2 0.72 10 1 1000 4 200 100 0 1 0
./sim 2 0.2 0.72 10 1 1000 4 200 100 0 1 0
./sim 3 0.2 0.72 10 1 1000 4 200 100 0 1 0


 The expected value curves are in the output files "data/GA_EX_ER_N1000_m0.72_b0.2.txt", "data/AS_EX_ER_N1000_m0.72_b0.2.txt", and

EXAMPLE

The following three command produces the data used in Figure 4 of
[1] for the Gillespie algorithm, Asynchronous updating and
Synchronous updating respectively. That case was SIS dynamics on a
fully connected network of 10 nodes with beta and mu both equal to
1 and one node initially infected

./sim 1 1 1 1 2 10 3 100000 0 1 1
./sim 2 1 1 1 2 10 3 100000 0 1 1
./sim 3 1 1 1 2 10 3 100000 0 1 1

The expected value curves that appear in Figure 3a, Figure 3b (for
dt=1/90) and Figure 3c are in the output files
"data/GA_EXdat_CG_N10_m1_b1.txt", "data/AS_EXdat_CG_N10_m1_b1.txt"
and "data/AS_EXdat_CG_N10_m1_b1.txt" respectively.

*For further inputs on the program outputs, see section "Simulation Outputs" below

EXAMPLE

The following commands simulate SIS dynamics with beta=1 and mu=1 on a real world router network (datasets openly available from the website http://snap.stanford.edu/data/oregon1.html) for the Gillespie Algorithm, Asynchronous updating and Synchronous updating. This network is stored in the file ``peer.oregon+.010526'' and is in the
form of a list of edges.

./sim 1 1 1 10 3 peer.oregon+.010526 200 100 0 1 0
./sim 2 1 1 10 3 peer.oregon+.010526 200 100 0 1 0
./sim 3 1 1 10 3 peer.oregon+.010526 200 100 0 1 0

*********************************
*  SIMULATION OUTPUTS		*
*********************************

The "Xdat", "EXdat" and "PXTdat" 1/0 flags dictate what output the program saves. Output files are saved in the directory 'data/'

---------------------------------
-		Xdat		-
---------------------------------

In each simulation, the fraction of infected nodes over time is recorded. Recordings are taken at 101** points throughout the simulation, beginning at time t=0 and ending at time t=tend. If the flag Xdat is set equal to 0, then these 101 recordings - for each of the N_trials realizations - are stored in an output file "AS_Xdat_….txt". In the output file, each row is for a time point while each column is for a different realisation i.e.

x(t=0, trial=1)		x(t=0, trial=2)		…	x(t=0, trial=N_trials)
x(t=t1, trial=1)	x(t=t1, trial=2)	…	x(t=t1, trial=N_trials)
…
x(t=tend, trial=1)	x(t=tend, trial=2)	…	x(t=tend, trial=N_trials)

** If more\less than 101 points are desired then the number can be set by changing the variable n_intervals at line 115 in the source code file "ASsim.cpp" and recompiling as described in the section "EDITING SOURCE CODE" below.

---------------------------------
-		EXdat		-
---------------------------------

The expected fraction of infected nodes over time can be computed by averaging the data described in "Xdat" over all of the realizations. If the flag EXdat is set equal to 1, then this expected fraction is saved in an output file "AS_EXdat…", again beginning at time t=0 and ending at time t=tend. In the output file, there is one column and the time evolution is along the rows i.e.

Ex(t=0)
Ex(t=t1)
…
Ex(t=tend)

---------------------------------
-		PXTdat		-
---------------------------------

This file stores the probability that there are X infected nodes at time t. This is done by counting the number of trials in which there are X infected individuals at time t, and computing the empirical probability density functions. If the flag PXTdat is equal to 1, then this empirical probability density function is stored in the output file "AS_PXTdat…" in the form

p(X=0,t=0)	p(X=1,t=0)	…	p(X=N,t=0)
p(X=0,t=t1)	p(X=1,t=0)	…	p(X=N,t=1)
…
p(X=0,t=tend)	p(X=1,t=tend)	…	p(X=N,t=tend)


*********************************
*  EDITING SOURCE CODE		*
*********************************

The source code files "main.cpp", "main.h", "GA.h", "AS.h" and "S.h" are located in the directory "source_code/". They can be edited to suit the preferences of users. After the source code files have been edited, the executable "sim" can be compiled by executing the following command two commands in the original directory:

g++ -c source_code/main.cpp
g++ -o sim source_code/main.o
